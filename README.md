A small Gnome extension for my workflow.

Start new windows maximized if the workspace is empty. Exceptions are not maximizable windows and wm classes of type pop-up (e.g.: Chrome apps)

# Installation

Copy `./src/` to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/gnome-shell-extension-max-if-lonely\@jensbin.github.com/`
